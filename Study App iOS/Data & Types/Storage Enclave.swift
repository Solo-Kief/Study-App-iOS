// The following is the purpose and goals of this file.
//
// Purpose: This file intends to handle non-specific application data. It will perform all data operations,
// provide data to the modules that request it, provide a singleton of data avaliable app wide, and be
// self persistant.

// To-Do list:
//
// Impliment Question lists locally.
// Impliment Question sets locally. I.E. It's seperate sets of questions that one can select from
// Impliment persistance for the questions and question lists.
// Impliment data access and modifying operations.
// Impliment application settings that will be determined at a later date.
// Make all data sets and application settings locally persistant.
// Bonus - Make a method for file based importation and exprotation for questions, question sets, themes, and settings.
